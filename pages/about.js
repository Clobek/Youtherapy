          <div className="center"><p>At an early age I always knew I would either own or operate a business. From childhood to adulthood I would help around my mother's businesses; it wasn't until I was older and managing my mother's beauty salon that my passion for the beauty industry began. 
          After extensive research I decided to attend Aveda Institute of Chicago where I fell in love with natural health and beauty. Training in both Cosmetology and Esthiology I worked with clients at Aveda salons as well as on the sets for music videos, fashion shows and even television shows. I loved all the services I provided but especially enjoyed my skincare appointments. It's because of this that I decided to further my education in skincare.</p> 
          
          <p>While pregnant and researching natural anti-aging treatments, I learned about these life changing treatments. After having my son, I went back to school to get certified for both the Fibroblast Plasma Pen as well as the Hyaluron Pen. Now, full circle I have opened my own business. Youtherapy Modern Skincare a you-nique beauty boutique specializing in natural-looking, non-surgical facial rejuvenation and skincare for both men and women. I am the first and only Fibroblast and Hyaluron technician in the Quad Cities. I remain dedicated to staying educated on the latest advancements/technology in natural skincare. My goal is to create a comfortable and private atmosphere focusing on making people feel beautiful, confident and more comfortable in their own skin.</p> 

          <p>*Due to high service requests I also travel between Chicago IL, Madison WI, Denver CO and Los Angeles CA. If you are interested in me coming to your area for a treatment please request a consultation.</p></div>
